			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White House slams Elon Musk for endorsing an "offensive" antisemitic conspiracy theory, calling it a "hideous lie." Musk's remarks draw criticism, adding to concerns about extremist content on social media.</p><p>X Chief Executive Linda Yaccarino expressed the company's commitment to combating antisemitism, emphasizing that such sentiments have no place in the world. Musk's endorsement appeared to support the "white genocide" conspiracy theory, suggesting that Jewish communities actively encourage immigration to Western countries to "eliminate" the white race. This theory has historical connections to violent attacks on synagogues, making Musk's remarks particularly controversial.</p><p>Despite Musk's denial of antisemitism, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other unspecified "Jewish communities" were singled out in his clarification. The ADL criticized Musk for validating antisemitic theories during a time when antisemitism is on the rise globally. The controversy surrounding antisemitism coincides with some organizations halting ad spending on X due to concerns about extremist content on the platform.</p><p>X, formerly known as Twitter, faced scrutiny as IBM and Apple suspended ad purchases after their ads were reportedly placed next to posts praising Adolf Hitler and Nazism. X responded by asserting that ads are not deliberately placed next to extremist content and that Nazi-promoting accounts won't earn money from advertising. The platform has also been criticized for its handling of hate speech and extremism, with external groups disputing X's claims of improved safety controls.</p><p>Elon Musk's past disputes with social media watchdogs, including the ADL, add another layer to the ongoing tensions around content moderation on X. Musk has repeated conspiracy theories and criticized watchdogs for their assessments of content moderation changes. X insists on having stronger brand safety controls, but external groups argue that extremism and hate speech have increased under Musk's leadership.</p><p>While Musk has not followed through on a threat to sue the ADL, he has filed a lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate, claiming their actions aim to censor and silence him. The controversies surrounding Musk's statements, content moderation, and legal battles contribute to the complex dynamics surrounding X and its role in addressing extremist content.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia clinched their sixth Men's World Cup title, led by Pat Cummins' strategic brilliance. The dramatic final shattered India's 10-game winning streak, adding a thrilling chapter to the tournament.</p><p>As Pat Cummins and his team celebrated their triumph, thousands of Indian supporters left the cricketing coliseum in disbelief. The anticipated fulfillment of India's destiny on home soil crumbled, with stalwarts like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Jasprit Bumrah unable to secure victory. Cummins, a Blue Mountains native, orchestrated a historic victory, leaving the Indian fans stunned.</p><p>Despite India's initial stumble, posting 240 all-out on a challenging pitch, their supporters clung to hope. In a chaotic start to the chase, Bumrah and Mohammed Shami wreaked havoc, seemingly sealing a match-winning performance. However, from the madness emerged Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne, displaying resilience that echoed through Australian cricket history.</p><p>Travis Head, who missed the first five tournament games due to a fractured hand, emerged as the unsung hero. Cummins' decision to keep Head in the lineup paid off handsomely. Head's masterful 137 from 120 balls, coupled with Labuschagne's steadfast 58 not out, successfully reeled in the target with four wickets down and seven overs to spare.</p><p>Labuschagne's contribution was equally crucial. While blunting India's spinners, he chiseled away at one end, allowing Head to take on the riskier role. Their formidable partnership of 192 runs showcased the kind of resilience and skill embedded in Australian cricket history.</p><p>Glenn Maxwell's mighty slog off Mohammed Siraj's delivery marked the culmination of the intense final. After the impressive fourth-wicket stand, Maxwell's powerful shot initiated a rush of teammates onto the field, leaving Sharma's men in stunned disbelief. The unforeseen victory unfolded dramatically, deviating from the anticipated script.</p><p>If Head and Labuschagne were the toast of Australians, Cummins was the mastermind behind the triumph. In a remarkable year that saw him lift the World Test Championship mace and retain the Ashes, this feat—walking into India's home coronation and seizing the crown—stands out as Cummins' crowning achievement.</p><p>As Cummins received the World Cup trophy from India's prime minister, the cricketing world witnessed the reminder that in sports, nothing is preordained. The 46-day procession for the hosts concluded with a stunning twist, cementing Australia's victory as a historic chapter in World Cup lore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<title>The Making of Apple’s Emoji: How designing these tiny icons changed my life</title>
			<link>https://netlify.scentbird.com/making-of-apples-emoji-how-designing-these-tiny-icons-changed-my-life</link>
			<author>Administrator</author>
			<category>Site News</category>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When design leads to friendship, and that friendship leads back to design, magic happens.</p><p>This is the story of how an intern and her mentor designed Apple’s original emoji set and together changed the way people communicate around the world. It was also a project that led them to become lifelong friends, a key ingredient in the success of these tiny icons. In a nutshell, I was the intern and Raymond is my lifelong friend and mentor. In the course of three months, together we created some of the most widely used emoji: face with tears of joy, pile of poo, red heart, and party popper, plus around 460 additional ones. Later, as a full time Apple employee, I even got to create a few more.</p><p>It was the summer of 2008, and I was one year away from receiving my MFA in Graphic Design from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). It was the same summer I landed an internship at Apple on a team I was eager to meet. The same design team responsible for the iPhone; a magical device that launched the year prior at Macworld Expo in San Francisco. One could only imagine the size of my butterflies as I flew to Cupertino and arrived at 1 Infinite Loop. To add to the uncontrollable fluttering, I had no idea what project I would be given, the size of the team, where I would sit, or if I could really bike to work (I’m terrible on bikes).</p><p>Soon after my arrival and meeting the team (oh and biking to work!) I was handed my project. I was still trying to make sense of the assignment I’d just received when someone asked if I knew what an emoji was. And well, I didn’t, and at the time, neither did the majority of the English speaking world. I answered ‘no’. This would all change, of course, as the iPhone would soon popularize them globally by offering an emoji keyboard. Moments later I learned what this Japanese word meant and that I was to draw hundreds of them. Just as I was looking down the hallway and internally processing, “This isn’t type or an exercise in layout, these are luscious illustrations,” I was assigned my mentor.</p><p>For the next three months Raymond and I would share an office and illustrated an array of faces, places, flags, animals, food, clothing, symbols, holidays, sports, and well, you probably know the rest. But long before any of this was complete, I had to learn how to design Apple-styled icons. We split the batch and the lesson in humility and craftsmanship began.Raymond taught me everything there was to know about icon design. Little did I know that he, my humble mentor, was one of the best icon designers in the world. In other words, I sat next to one of the best iconographers, got to pick his brain until I could kick off my training wheels, all the while exchanging stories of our time growing up in South Florida including our trips to ‘Pollo Tropical’ in the search of amazing plantains. Lesson in humility, check. My first emoji was the engagement ring, and I chose it because it had challenging textures like metal and a faceted gem, tricky to render for a beginner. The metal ring alone took me an entire day. Pretty soon, however, I could do two a day, then three, and so forth. Regardless of how fast I could crank one out, I constantly checked the details: the direction of the woodgrain, how freckles appeared on apples and eggplants, how leaf veins ran on a hibiscus, how leather was stitched on a football, the details were neverending. I tried really hard to capture all this in every pixel, zooming in and zooming out, because every detail mattered. And for three months I stared at hundreds of emoji on my screen. Somewhere in there we also had our first Steve Jobs review, which had created a shared experience of suspense and success when they were approved for launch. And if Steve said it was good to go, I’d say lesson in craftsmanship, check. Sometimes our emoji turned out more comical than intended and some have a backstory. For example, Raymond reused his happy poop swirl as the top of the ice cream cone. Now that you know, bet you’ll never forget. No one else who discovered this little detail did either. Another example is the order in which we drew them. We left the tough ones to last, so the dancer with the red dress emerged towards the end of my internship as it was the one that kept getting punted. You can thank her ruffled dress for that and Raymond for the final output. The woman’s turquoise dress with the brown waist band, on the other hand, was one I drew earlier in the process. It was inspired by the color palette and proportions of a dress that my sister had created in real life that same year. So from funny backstories to realizing he and I attended high schools less than 30 miles apart, our shared past and days drawing together triggered unstoppable laughing spells with watery eyes and all, in other words, with tears of joy. Ten years after my internship, Raymond and I still fill a room with laughter and he continues to provide me with the most flat out honest feedback to keep me in check, and vice versa. All this is what I believe made the emoji successful, our friendship through design.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Megan Rapinoe, celebrated in the realm of U.S. soccer, faced the spotlight for her last professional match at San Diego's Snapdragon Stadium. The game marked the conclusion of an illustrious career filled with triumphs both on and off the field.</p><p>However, in a surprising turn of events, Rapinoe's final match took an unexpected turn in the third minute when she went down, ultimately signaling the end of her career.</p><p>The fall occurred as Rapinoe was defending against Gotham FC midfielder Maitane Lopez. Despite not tripping or being tackled, Rapinoe planted her foot incorrectly, leading to the injury. With tears shed and moments spent sitting on the field, Rapinoe was eventually helped up, limping off the pitch. Although a stretcher was available, she opted not to use it, allowing Bethany Balcer to substitute in her place.</p><p>Despite the unfortunate conclusion to Rapinoe's career, the game proceeded, and her team, OL Reign, faced Gotham FC in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) finals. The Reign ultimately succumbed to a 2-1 defeat, with Gotham's Lynn Williams scoring the first goal 20 minutes after Rapinoe left the field. The Reign's Rose Lavelle responded with a goal shortly after, but Gotham's Esther González scored again in the final minutes of the first half, securing their victory.</p><p>In the closing moments of the game, OL Reign nearly scored a second goal, which could have tied the match. However, Gotham's goalkeeper, Mandy Haught, made a crucial save. Unfortunately for Haught, she received a red card after a review for handling the ball outside the box, denying the Reign a clear goalscoring opportunity.</p><p>As the final whistle blew, Gotham celebrated its first NWSL Championship in history. Rapinoe, despite her injury, made a symbolic entrance onto the field wearing a boot on her right foot. The match also featured a poignant moment as Rapinoe, leaving the field after her injury, received a hug from Gotham's Ali Krieger, another U.S. Women’s National Team stalwart who played her final professional match on the same day.</p><p>Megan Rapinoe, aged 38, had previously announced her retirement over the summer, concluding a stellar career. Hailing from Redding, California, Rapinoe leaves behind a legacy as one of America’s most accomplished female athletes. With four World Cup appearances and two Olympic gold and bronze medals, Rapinoe's list of achievements is extensive. Notably, her standout performance in the 2019 World Cup earned her the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards.</p><p>Beyond her athletic prowess, Rapinoe actively used her platform for social advocacy, championing causes such as Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ rights, and women's equality. Her outspokenness, at times sparking disputes with then-President Donald Trump, earned her the label of a "walking protest." Rapinoe was a key figure in the push for equal pay in U.S. Soccer, culminating in a historic collective bargaining agreement last year.</p><p>In addition to her sporting accolades, Rapinoe's trophy case boasts the 2019 Ballon d’Or Féminin, Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year in 2019, the 2019 FIFA award for best female player, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded in the previous year. Rapinoe's impact extended beyond the field, challenging norms and advocating for inclusivity, making her an enduring figure in the world of sports.</p>]]></content:encoded>

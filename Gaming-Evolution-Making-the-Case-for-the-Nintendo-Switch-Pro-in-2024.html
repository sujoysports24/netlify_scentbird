          <p>The Nintendo Switch burst onto the gaming scene in 2017, offering a revolutionary hybrid home/portable console experience.</p>

          <p>Over 100 million units sold later, it remains one of the most popular consoles ever released.</p>

          <p>However, with rival next-gen offerings from Sony and Microsoft raising the graphical benchmark, I believe that Nintendo could release an upgraded “Switch 2” model going into 2024.</p>

          <p><h2>Processing Power and Graphics</h2></p>
		  
          <p>The current Switch utilizes Nvidia’s custom Tegra X1 processor, which was cutting-edge technology in 2017.</p>

          <p>However, it struggles to match the graphical capabilities of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles.</p>

          <p>An upgraded CPU/GPU would enable 4K graphics when docked, bringing Nintendo closer to parity with Sony and Microsoft.</p>

          <p>Potential upgrades for a Switch 2 processor include:</p>

          <p>* Nvidia’s latest Tegra chipset (Parker or Orin)</p>
          <p>* Customized AMD processor similar to Steam Deck</p>
          <p>* DLSS integration for AI-powered upscaling</p>
          <p>* Implementing Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology could also help a Switch 2 match the native 4K output of rival consoles.</p>
          <p>* DLSS uses AI to upscale lower-resolution graphics to 4K without a substantial performance hit.</p>
          <p>* With significantly faster base hardware and DLSS, a Switch 2 could output impressive 4K visuals when docked while retaining better battery life for portable play.</p>

          <p><h2>Improved Battery Life</h2></p>
		  
          <p>The original Switch’s maximum battery life caps out at around 5–9 hours, depending on the game and settings.
          <p>
          <p>For a portable-focused console, this falls well short of expectations.
          <p>
          <p>Nintendo could take inspiration from the Steam Deck and leverage advanced power management and lower-nanometer chips to substantially extend on-the-go playtime.
          <p>
          <p>Upgrades might include:
          <p>
          <p>More advanced 40nm or 28nm chip manufacturing
          <p>Customized power management firmware
          <p>Higher-density battery technology
          <p>With these upgrades, battery life for a Switch 2 could hit the 7–10 hour range if things are looking good, allowing for possible lengthy travel gaming sessions.

          <p><h2>Timing of a Potential 2024 Release</h2></p>
		  
          <p>Analysts debate whether 2024 is the right timeframe for launching a Switch successor versus a simple mid-generation upgrade like the Switch OLED.
          <p>
          <p>Nonetheless, 2024 holds some compelling reasoning from both strategic and component availability standpoints.

          <p><h2>Maturing Console Cycle</h2></p>
		  
          <p>By 2024, the normal console cycle maturity suggests sales of PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch will naturally decline without newer/upgraded models available.
          <p>
          <p>Releasing a shiny upgraded Switch in 2024 would enable Nintendo to restart momentum later in the cycle.

          <p><h2>Supply Chain Improvements</h2></p>
		  
          <p>The global chip shortage has severely constrained the production of current-gen consoles. However, component supplies are projected to steadily improve through 2023. An upgraded Switch launching in 2024 would sidestep supply issues faced by earlier consoles.</p>

          <p><h2>4K Adoption Rates</h2></p>
          <p>Although 4K television adoption continues growing rapidly, standard 1080p TVs currently still dominate households globally.</p>
          <p>
          <p>If Nintendo timed the Switch 2 launch for 2024 or later, 4K capability would match the install base of supporting televisions.</p>

          <p><h2>Strong First-Party Game Support</h2></p>
		  
          <p>While hardware specs are crucial, software sells systems.</p>
          <p>
          <p>Nintendo enjoys arguably the strongest first-party software lineup amongst console manufacturers.</p>
          <p>Series like The Legend of Zelda, Mario, Smash Bros, Splatoon, and more move millions of console units.</p>
          <p>A sampling of major Switch game franchises that could drive Switch 2 hardware adoption include:</p>
          <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2</p>
          <p>New 3D Mario platformer</p>
          <p>Mario Kart 9</p>
          <p>Super Smash Bros Ultimate sequel</p>
          <p>Splatoon 3 sequel</p>
          <p>Metroid Prime 4</p>
          <p>These system-selling franchises can drive multi-million unit sales on nostalgia and brand recognition alone. Combined with upgraded Switch 2 capabilities, Nintendo’s first-party games could propel the console to new heights.</p>
 
          <p><h2>Stiff Competition in the Console Market</h2></p>
		  
          <p>While Nintendo’s software lineup and hybrid console portability stand out from the competition, both Sony and Microsoft are heating the console battle as well.</p>

          <p>The capabilities of the PS5 and Xbox Series X pose an existential threat if Nintendo falls too far behind in technological capabilities.</p>

          <p><h2>PlayStation 5 Powerhouse</h2></p>
		  
          <p>The PS5 features genre-defining exclusives like God of War: Ragnarok alongside cutting-edge graphics and near-instant load times. PlayStation also continues investing heavily in critical and fan-adored franchises like Spider-Man, The Last of Us, Gran Turismo, and more.</p>

          <p><h2>Xbox Game Pass with Activision Blizzard</h2></p>
		  
          <p>Xbox may lack the sheer number of exclusives but more than compensates with Game Pass — a Netflix-style gaming subscription with hundreds of downloadable games playable on many platforms.</p>

          <p>Microsoft’s concluded $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard will further boost Game Pass with more hit games going into 2024, and I am excited to potentially see Game Pass hit the Nintendo Switch ecosystem in 2024.</p>

          <p>Given Sony and Microsoft’s increasingly dominant positions, Nintendo faces growing pressure to substantially upgrade Switch hardware to stay competitive.</p>

          <p><h2>Conclusion: Bold Move or Wait and See?</h2></p>
		  
          <p>Considering the massive success but aging components of the original Switch, Nintendo has difficult decisions regarding if/when to release upgraded hardware.</p>

          <p>While 2024 holds compelling reasons around console lifecycles, component availability, and software pipelines, a conservative “wait and see” approach has also served Nintendo well historically.</p>

          <p>After all, they do usually subvert expectations with their new releases.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, with strong new offerings from the competition, Nintendo must walk a tightrope balancing bold investment in more powerful (and more expensive) hardware versus maximizing profit on proven older designs.</p>

          <p>If PlayStation and Xbox continue aggressively pushing technology and market share post-pandemic though, 2024 could be the year Nintendo finally makes an undeniably bold move with a Switch 2.</p>
